## A web page created using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet showing 6 Israeli cities and their population.

```{r preprocessing}
library(leaflet)
library(dplyr)

setwd("c:/Users/tal.darchi/OneDrive - Sapiens/Desktop/")
israelCities <- subset(read.csv("worldcities.csv"), country == "Israel")
```

```{r leaflet}
map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng = israelCities$lng,
             lat = israelCities$lat,
             popup =paste(israelCities$city, "<br>Population: ",
                         formatC(israelCities$population, format = "d", big.mark = ",")
             )
  ) %>% 
  addCircles(lng    = israelCities$lng, 
             lat    = israelCities$lat, 
             weight = 1,
             radius = sqrt(israelCities$population) * 20)
